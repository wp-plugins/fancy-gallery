Fancy Gallery associates linked images and galleries with the jQuery Fancybox. This Plugin has been granted the "Famous Software" Award!

== Description ==

= LATEST NEWS! =
* [There is a PROFESSIONAL EDITION of this Plugin available now](http://wpplugins.com/plugin/870/fancy-gallery-pro)!
* Fancy Gallery has been granted the "Famous Software" Award! [To the post &raquo;](http://download.famouswhy.com/fancy_gallery/)

= Description =
Fancy Gallery integrates the [Fancy Image Box](http://fancybox.net) in your WordPress. All links pointing to an image will automatically open in the FancyBox. If you use the [gallery] Short-code the images will get a navigation bar and the gallery itself will be converted into a valid XHTML block.

Of course you can use 'exclude' and 'include' parameters in your [gallery] short-code.

If you want to display links in the fancybox add the class "fancyframe" to them! ;)

= Requirements =
* **Fancy Gallery requires PHP5.2!**
* WordPress 3.0 or higher

= Settings =
You can find the settings page in WP Admin Panel &raquo; Settings &raquo; Fancy Gallery.

= Questions =
If you have any questions you can leave a comment in my blog. But please think about this: I will not add features, write customizations or write tutorials for free. Please think about a donation. I'm a human and to write code is hard work.
