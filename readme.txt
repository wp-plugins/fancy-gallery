Fancy Gallery is a GALLERY MANAGEMENT & IMAGE LIGHTBOX tool which helps you to manage and present your image galleries.


== Description ==
[Fancy Gallery](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/fancy-gallery) is a state of the art [WordPress Gallery Management tool](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/fancy-gallery) which enables you to create, manage and handle image galleries easily in your WordPress backend, embed these galleries in your posts or pages and present them to your website visitors. ¹

Furthermore the plugin adds a beautiful awesome *javascript lightbox effect* to all links pointing to an image anywhere on your website. This includes images in your posts, galleries, pages, sidebar widgets or anywhere else on your website. In detail this means all links - regardless if text or image - pointing to an image will automatically opened in a responsive lightbox. If you use the [gallery] shortcode the images will get a "previous" and "next" button and a slideshow button and the gallery itself will be converted to a valid HTML5 block - even if your theme does not support HTML5 galleries yet.

Of course you can use "exclude" and "include" parameters in your [gallery] shortcode like you already know from the traditional gallery code.


= Main features =
In this version of [Fancy Gallery](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/fancy-gallery) some features are not available or limited. You will find notices on several places in the backend that the described feature is part of the [premium version](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/fancy-gallery).

* Lightbox support for all linked images on your website.
* Manage galleries separated from posts or pages.
* Gallery taxonomies to categorize all your image galleries.
* Custom thumbnail sizes and color effects.¹
* Fully compatible with all existing themes with archive template.
* Template engine to display your galleries.
* User role and capability support.¹
* Gallery archives and RSS feed support.
* Clean and easy-to-use user interfaces.
* Widgets to display your images in the sidebars.¹
* Completely free of advertisement and brandings.¹

¹Available in the [premium version of Fancy Gallery](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/fancy-gallery).

= Settings =
You can find the settings page in WP admin panel &raquo; Settings &raquo; [Fancy Gallery](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/fancy-gallery).


= Limitations =
There are no real limitations in this version except the number of galleries you can handle within the gallery management tool. The maximal number of galleries is limited to three but of course you can use the traditional galleries in your posts and pages *without* any limitations!

= Gallery Templates =
To create your own gallery template you only need elementary HTML and PHP knowledge. Just start by creating a new HTML file with the following example header with the template details.

<code>
/*
Fancy Gallery Template: Template Name
Description: Your template description here.
Version: 1.0
Author: John Doe
Author URI: http://example.com
*/
</code>

You can place the template in these folders:

1. If it is for your own website put it in /wp-content/fancy-gallery-templates.
1. If you are a theme author just put in your theme (max one level deep).
1. If you are a plugin developer use the "fancy_gallery_template_files" to add template files from anywhere.
1. Absolutely not recommended: in the "templates/" folder of the plugin itself.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.7 or greater
* PHP version 5.3 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you do not need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Fancy Gallery, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "Fancy Gallery" and click "Search Plugins". Once you have found my gallery plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading my gallery plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
